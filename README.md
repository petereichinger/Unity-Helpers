Helper classes that are useful for Unity projects

I'll add helper classes that I often use in Unity projects

## Description

## Mass Set Tags Tool

This tool simply sets the tags of all selected objects and their children.
The class is `Scripts/EditorTools/Editor/MassSetTags.cs` and it can be accessed via `UnityHelpers -> Mass Set Tags`
